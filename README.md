# Heart Attack Risk Prediction (Group 9 - WQD7006/WQD7012)
A machine learning project developed for the course WQD7006/WQD7012 - Machine Learning for Data Science, aiming to predict the risk of heart attack based on health and lifestyle indicators. The system is deployed using Streamlit for interactive access and demonstration.

# Model Overview

- **Input Features**:  
  Body Mass Index (BMI), sleep hours, general health status, chronic disease history, age, and other demographic and health-related indicators.

- **Models Used for Evaluation**:  
  Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost were trained and compared.

- **Deployed Model**:  
  We selected **Logistic Regression** as the final deployed model.

- **Imbalanced Data Handling**:  
  A hybrid approach combining **SMOTE** and **ENN** was used to address class imbalance.

- **Evaluation Metrics**:  
  Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC.
